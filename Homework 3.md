           $$E=mc^2$$
  
   where v is the velocity and g = 9.8 m/s^2 is the acceleration due to gravity.Write a program 
   that employs the Euler method to compute the solution to (1.8); that is, calculate v as a fu
   nction of t. For simplicity, assume that the initial velocity is zero—that is, the object st
   arts from rest—and calculate the solution for times t = 0 to t = 10 s. Repeat the calculatio
   n for several different values of the time step, and compare the results with the exact solu
   tion to (1.8). It turns out that for this case the Euler method gives the exact result. Veri
   fy this with your numerical results and prove it analytically（习题：1.1）.
